## Copy rules for Google

- Headlines are assembled by Google in any combination. Every headline must stand alone and must not depend on another one.
- Do not reuse Google search headlines on Meta and vice versa. Search answers intent; social must earn attention (secondary source, unverified).
- Keep text off the image. Google assembles text next to the image and may overlay its own.

## Synthetic content attestation (secondary source, unverified)

From Google Ads API v25 every uploaded image and video asset must carry a `synthetic_content_info` attestation stating whether it was AI generated or altered. Set it on every asset the pipeline uploads, and set it truthfully. AI backgrounds and AI-generated b-roll count as synthetic even when the logo and copy were composed in HTML.

Related handoff rules: Google's AssetGenerationService is closed beta and Product Studio is a pilot, so upload finished masters through AssetService rather than relying on in-platform generation.
