# Slideshows and carousels

Read when the post is a TikTok slideshow (photo mode) or an Instagram or
LinkedIn carousel. Each platform takes the slides as separate images.
There is no video to render.

## The slides

- **Slide 1 is the hook**: the promise of the whole set in at most eight
  words ("5 signs you need one system"). Most people decide here.
- **One point per slide**, at most twelve words, big enough to read on a
  phone. Five to eight slides; the last one says what to do next ("Save
  this", "Follow for part 2").
- **One look across the set**: write the style once in the folder's
  `anchor.md` and put it in every slide's prompt. Use slide 1 as the
  reference for the rest.
- **Sizes**: 9:16 for TikTok, 4:5 for Instagram, 1:1 or 4:5 for LinkedIn.

## Making them

Use the owner's photos first: a slide may be their photo with the line
set on it (an edit of the photo). Otherwise `make-image` sets the line in
the picture.

Number the slides in order. Each has a `slide-N.md` with its prompt under a
`## Prompt` heading, and a `slide-N.jpg` made from it (`--prompt-file
slide-N.md --section Prompt`). Every slide after the first passes `--ref
slide-1.jpg`. Put the caption and hashtags in `creative.md` as for any
post, and list every `slide-N.jpg` in its `files`. Before the owner sees
the set, read every slide at full size for misspelt words.
