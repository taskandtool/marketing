# Social post

The platform shows a post to more people when the first ones send, save,
comment or keep watching. So open with a moment, a number or a question the
reader recognises, give something worth keeping, and ask for one small
thing the platform rewards.

Example, for Instagram:

```
Three of the five boilers we saw this week had the same problem: pressure under 1 bar.

Check yours now. The gauge is on the front, usually bottom left. Between 1 and 1.5 is right when the heating's off. Under 1, top it up with the filling loop (a video on how is in our highlights).

Save this for the first cold morning.
```

## Steps

Copy and tick:

- [ ] 1. **Pillar and platform.** Education, proof, behind the scenes,
      offer (at most one post in five) or community
      (`references/repurpose.md`). First read `references/<platform>.md`
      for the idea's platform.
- [ ] 2. **The idea**, from the sources below.
- [ ] 3. **The hook and the words** (the `copywriting` skill). The first
      line stands alone: the hook and its payoff before the platform's
      visible cutoff (in `specs/<platform>.md`; for X and Google Business, in
      their `references/` file).
- [ ] 4. **The ask**, one, matched to what the platform rewards: "Save
      this", "Send this to someone planning a kitchen", "Reply with yours".
      Links stay out of the body on Facebook, LinkedIn and X.
- [ ] 5. **The picture**: the owner's photo as it is or edited, a
      carousel of real job photos, a slideshow (`references/slideshow.md`),
      a short clip (the `video` skill), or one made from scratch (the
      Pictures section of `AGENTS.md`).
- [ ] 6. Write `creatives/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>/creative.md` with `kind: post`,
      the whole caption as it will be pasted in `copy.caption`, and any
      hashtags in `copy.hashtags` as one line (`"#sarasotacoffee
      #downtownsarasota"`). Run `python3 scripts/check.py`, then
      `python3 scripts/preview.py <folder> --send "<line>"`: the owner sees
      it as the feed will show it. A week of posts is one call.
- [ ] 7. **Posting**, once approved: through a posting connection the
      owner has (Zernio, Hootsuite), scheduled for the time they chose,
      then `status: posted` and the live `url`. With none, the owner posts
      it.

## Where post ideas come from

Every enquiry and FAQ ("people always ask"); the job in hand (before and
after, a detail, one decision explained); reviews (the quote, then the story
behind it); the objection competitors leave unanswered; the season and the
local calendar; comments on the owner's own posts (answer them as posts);
the owner's own numbers and opinions; and any ad that won, recut for the
feed.

## One idea, a week of posts

Write the set as `references/repurpose.md` says: each platform's version
rewritten for that platform, never pasted across. Accounts that mostly
repost or cross-post unchanged lose reach on Instagram and Facebook.

## Rules

- Replying to comments is part of the post; suggest the owner does it in the
  first hour.
- No engagement bait ("tag a friend"), no hashtag walls, no watermarked
  reposts.
- A review is quoted as written, with permission; customer photos with
  permission and credit.
